The app integrates the MealDB API to provide an in-app recipe search engine tailored to user input and leverages Firebase for user authentication and a public chat forum. I implemented Python’s NLTK library to create a Naïve Bayes algorithm that classifies user moods (e.g., happy, sad) based on text inputs found in the library's lexicon dictionary and visualized this data using matplotlib, enabling users to track their emotional well-being in their recovery. The app achieved recognition as a Top 8 Semifinalist in Canada for the Technovation Girls Competition.",

My partner and I were exploring the sustainable energy space when we decided to deep dive into the world of wireless electricity. Bumblee was a pivot from a larger-scale idea of implementing a completely wireless energy grid by utilizing MRC (Magnetic Resonance Coupling) technology and enhancing its efficiency with radio wave energy harvesters. Our thinking sought to solve the issue of vulnerable physical infrastructure affecting access to electricity in remote regions and areas impacted by severe natural disasters. We pivoted to the Bumblee battery pack after understanding the associated risks of a completely wireless grid (although we are not far from a future where this exists). Instead, we implemented our previous system—without coupling—on a smaller scale, where energy is supplied through photovoltaic technology and radio wave energy harvesters.",

My research in the fashion sustainability space and interviews with niche non-profits revealed that 80% of clothing donations are exported overseas to developing countries, rather than being distributed within our own economy to help scale local charities, non-profits, or aid people in need. I developed a mobile app solution to address this issue by creating a platform that organizes the allocation of excess donations to charities and non-profits. I developed the platform in a week using React Native, Firebase, and Nativewind CSS. I developed a Calendly variation from scratch for scheduling functionality in the app, a direct messaging system, and a browsing page. I have partnered with the local non-profit Good-Neighbor, planning to utilize the app to increase their garment supply and reach more people in need.",
