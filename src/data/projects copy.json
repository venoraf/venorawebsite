To do this, we process real-time EEG data to identify moments of high concentration by focusing on a specific range of brain wave frequencies known as beta band power. To isolate these frequencies, we applied a Butterworth bandpass filter. We then used these frequencies as a trigger action: in this case, if high concentration is detected, press spacebar. How goated is this.",
